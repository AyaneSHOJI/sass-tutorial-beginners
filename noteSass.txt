- install Live Sass Compiler
- go to setting and search Sass
- add this code in setting.json
"liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [
        {
            "format": "expanded",
            "extensionName": ".css",
            "savePath": "/dist/css"
        }

-create "dist" folder with index.html,"css" and main.css
-click button watch Sass
-add background color in main.scss file (DO NOT MODIFY main.css FILE)
-create a variable with $
-create a map with variables list,
-map-get($variable, key) to use a variable in map
-nesting element inside is possible (<p> in <main>)
-nestign class inside of parent is possible and not to need to write the entire name(.main_paragraphe inside .main can be write #{&}_paragraph, {&} is interpolation)
-hover can be added inside with &:hover
-create _resets.scss file in scss folder, import in main.css file without extension name
-create _variables.scss file in scss folder, import in main.css file without extension name
-having _resets.scss and _variables.scss is very helpful for work with a team on large project
-make a function as JS, @function funcName(param){@return func}
-make a mixin, a component with CSS properties that can be reused, @include nameOfMixin
-difference between function and mixin : function returns a value, mixin defines styles
-@mixin exemple, light / dark mode : create @mixin with @if statement, sass lighten and darken functions
-darken syntax => darken($color, $amount)
-@mixin for media queries, can be used with @include, it is recommended to create width _variables
-modify styles partially with @extend
-calculation is possible but can't mix types
